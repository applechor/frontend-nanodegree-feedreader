For more information about [getting started with jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)

## Getting started with this project

* download/clone [the project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) from GitHub.

* open `index.html` with browser to examine the application and expected results.

* open `js/app.js` with text editor to explore the main function for loading feeds.

* open `css/style.css` with text editor to explore how to use CSS stylings into the web page.

* open `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` with text editor to write the sutie tests, spec tests and expectation function.

## Unit testing

* Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.

* Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

* Write a new test suite named "The menu".

* Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.

* Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.

* Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".

* Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.

* Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".

* Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
